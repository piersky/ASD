## ASD - Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica

ASD is a sport association management software with the aim to help amateurish sport associations in managing:
- athletes' informations:
  - address
  - contacts
  - medical examination
  - etc.
- parents' information
- groups' composition
- payments:
  - each athlete payment history
  - group situation
  - etc.
- role management:
    - admin
    - manager
    - user
    
## ASD: a Laravel based project

This project is based on the robust and most used web app development framework called [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). This means that ASD is secure, robust and constantly up-to-date.

A large community is constantly bug fixing the core in order to follow the latest security rules. ASD implements Google re-captcha V3 and email alert whenever a user has logged in. In the database are store every login failed attempting. 

In my primerely intentions this project is for whom wants to learn programming Laravel, PHP, CSS, JS and SQL and feel part of a project and is in contact with sport associations which often have... little money to spend ;)

## Future developments

In the road map there are a lot of ideas...:
- adding the coaches management
- inserting payments directly by a single coach
- parents' capability to check only their payments status
- etc...
